However, achieving high performance in these systems can be challenging. ML systems are run on different types of hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) that have unique performance characteristics. Models are becoming larger and larger, and even with access to the most powerful hardware, systems must manage memory bandwidth and network bandwidth carefully when doing training and inference.

Biomed students compensate for programming assignments with comparable work for a final project. Graduate credit is obtained by a final project devoted to a research problem.

    "description": "Understanding language requires transforming sequences of sounds into words, combining words into meaningful thoughts, and incorporating thoughts into an ongoing discourse. Psychologists and linguists have been trying to reverse-engineer how humans do this so easily, at the speed of conversation. In parallel, computer scientists have been trying to engineer machines to solve the same problems, leading to products like Siri and Alexa. This class will explore how these two kinds of research can help each other, bringing recent insights from machine learning into the study of human language processing, and insights from human processing into the architectures of machine language systems. For CS students: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computational Linguistics (or comparable experience). For CLPS students: At least one of CLPS 0200, 0300, 0800, or 1800",

We will explore tree reconstruction algorithms using phylogenetic techniques (perfect phylogeny and Dollo parsimony) and population genetic techniques (branching processes and the coalescent).  The second theme is the identification of combinations of cancer causing mutations.  Such combinations typically result from biological interactions between genes, which are represented via graphs, or networks.  We will examine algorithms to analyze data on graphs including random walks (e.g. PageRank), diffusion processes, community detection, and spectral methods for graph partitioning.

    "description": "This course is devoted to computational problems and methods in the emerging field of Medical Bioinformatics where genomics, computational biology and bioinformatics impact medical research. We will present challenging problems and solutions in three areas: Disease Associations, Protein Folding and Immunogenomics.\nGenome-wide disease association studies (GWAS) present major computational challenges. The goal is to identify inherited genetic variation and its critical role in human disease. Huge datasets containing billions of SNPs, such as the Multiple Sclerosis Consortium GWAS data, will be a subject of our investigations. We will also discuss GWAS analyses for type 2 diabetes (common variants) and mental diseases (rare variants).\nThe computational protein folding problem, the classical grand challenge of biotechnology, can be stated as follows: can we computationally predict the 3-D native structure of a protein from its 1-D amino acid sequence? Lattice models of protein folding, although unrealistic, contain longstanding unsolved combinatorial and algorithmic problems of exceeding difficulty. Alzheimer's disease has been linked to protein (mis)folding.\nDo pathogens evolve their proteomes to avoid the surveillance of the human immune system? Killer T-cells, the 'special forces' of the human immune system, travel throughout the body and eliminate cells that 'display' on their surfaces short pieces of pathogen proteins, called epitopes that are difficult to computationally predict. We will search for epitopes in the immunopeptidomes of H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, HIV, vaccinia, herpesviruses and M. tuberculosis.\nThis course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates with Computational or Life Science backgrounds.

In particular, we use ideas adapted from *combinatorial topology*, a branch of topology that focuses on discrete constructions.\nAlthough computer science itself is based on discrete mathematics, combinatorial topology and its applications may still be unfamiliar to many computer scientists.  For this reason, this course provides a self-contained, elementary introduction to the concepts from combinatorial topology needed to analyze distributed computing. Conversely, while the systems and models used here are standard in computer science, they may be unfamiliar to students with a background in pure or applied mathematics.

There has been tremendous success in developing unified neural architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance on language understanding (GPT-3), visual perception (ViT), and even protein structure prediction (AlphaFold). We plan to understand how they work, and how the success of such unified models can give rise to further developments on self-supervised learning, a technique that trains machine learning models without requiring labeled data; and multimodal learning, a technique that utilizes multiple input sources, such as vision, audio, and text. We will study recent attempts to interpret these models, thus revealing potential risks on model bias. Paper reading, student presentations, and invited guest lectures. Students required to work on a final project that explores a novel direction along the line of the papers we cover.",

The course will focus on the latest advances through lectures, readings, and discussion groups. The lectures and readings will be designed to represent a mix of classical techniques as well as the most recent advances in the two fields. The unique highlight of this course is the inclusion of a practical component: students will implement a project that combines computer vision and robotics by using cameras and a real robot arm. Students will form teams for this project and have exclusive access to a camera and a small robot arm both of which can be interfaced with the students' laptops.

Thousands of warehouse robots autonomously zip around each other in a highly structured and specialized environment that makes coordination look easy, while military robots are often teleoperated by more than one person, making coordination difficult. Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems? In this course, we study the past, present, and future of coordinated mobile robotics, including a discussion of ethics. The majority of this course is a seminar-style survey of issues and approaches for control and coordination in multi-robot systems.",

In this course, we will (1) cover basic tools in linear algebra, matrix calculus, and statistics that are useful in theoretical machine learning, (2) explore different adversarial models and examine whether existing algorithms are robust in these models, and (3) design and analyze provably robust algorithms for fundamental tasks in machine learning. In particular, we will focus on the research areas of high-dimensional robust statistics, non-convex optimization, learning with strategic agents, and spectral graph theory. This is a research-oriented course where students are asked to read and present sophisticated papers in top machine learning conferences. Knowledge of basic linear algebra, algorithms, data structures, probability and statistics is essential. Prior experience with machine learning is required.",

The course will cover not only many of the recurring mathematical tools in algorithms but also the ways in which these tools are used to design algorithms with rigorous guarantees.

More and more, however, the limitations of worst-case analysis become apparent and create new challenges. In practice, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework of analysis. In this graduate seminar course, we will review several alternatives to worst-case analysis, developed largely in the theoretical computer science literature over the past 20 years, and their most notable algorithmic applications.
